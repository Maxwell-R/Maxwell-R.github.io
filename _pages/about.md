I received my B.E. degree in the Internet of Things Engineering at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) (CSU), China, in 2022. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/) (UCAS), China. My research focuses on edge intelligence, particularly in the areas of computing, networking, and communications. My work aims to advance the integration of intelligent computing at the network edge, addressing challenges related to resource management, data processing, and real-time decision-making in distributed environments.
